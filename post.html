        <h1>Measuring a blog's <em>success</em>:</h1>
        <h2>focus on <em>conversations</em>, not page views</h2>
        <time datetime="13-04-2022">13th April, 2022</time>


        <p>I’ve been writing this blog now for a little over 4 years. I’ve found it to be a really rewarding and fun
            thing
            to do – more people than I can count have told me that this blog has helped them, lots of you have helped me
            figure things out, and just the act of writing down confusing things has taught me so much.</p>

        <p>I want to talk a little about what what it means for a blog to be “successful” (and how I think about success
            for this blog) because I think independent blogs are kind of a wonderful + magical thing – I have a site
            that I
            own! And lots of people have signed up to get updates when I post, because they’re interested in what I’m
            saying. And there isn’t any other intermediary (a newspaper/facebook/twitter/anyone) who we have to appeal
            to,
            it’s just up to me to write interesting things and up to people whether they want to subscribe or not.</p>

        <p>A lot of the posts I’ve seen about building a successful blog (like this one) are very SEO/marketing heavy
            and
            seem to assume your goal is to maximize page views. I haven’t found maximizing to be that rewarding.
            <strong>So what
                does success look like if it doesn’t mean “maximize page views”?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>This post isn’t really about how to build the Biggest Most Popular Blog (I think small blogs with small
            audiences are wonderful and important things!). It’s more about how I think about building a blog which is
            fun
            and useful and where I feel connected with people who read it.</p>

        <p>I’ll also talk a little bit about metrics that I find more meaningful than page views (like subscribers) and
            how
            to track those!</p>

        <h3>focus on conversations, not page views</h3>

        <p> Like many website authors, I’ve spent my share of time looking nervously at Google Analytics for my site
            (“do people like me? Oh wow! People are visiting my site! wow!”). I haven’t found stressing about google
            analytics numbers to be that useful – if 2x or 5x more people visit my site this month than last month, so
            what? It
            doesn’t really feel that meaningful to me.</p>

        <p>I find it much more useful to ask myself – am I having interesting conversations / learning things with as a
            result of blogging? A couple examples of times I’ve had great conversations as a result of blogging:</p>

        <p>I’ve been writing up my progress on building a Ruby profiler, and other profiler authors have told me a lot
            of
            interesting things about their experiences writing profilers. I’ve gotten some really helpful tips.</p>

        <p>Or, last year I wrote a lot of blog posts about Kubernetes as I was trying to figure out how to use it. One
            awesome thing that happened as a result of that is that someone from another company IMed me to ask me
            questions, and they ended up sharing the code for a super interesting container project that gave me new
            great
            ideas. I would never have talked to that person if it weren’t for my blog!</p>

        <p>Talking about what I’m working on in public means that other people working in the same field can tell me
            useful
            things and help me out, which is awesome.</p>

        <p>A result of this attitude is that I don’t write about topics I’m not interested in having discussions with
            people about! Like I could write a post about cryptocurrencies and it might even be helpful to some people,
            but
            I’m not interested in talking about cryptocurrencies, so I probably won’t write about that!</p>
